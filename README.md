#### Issue with existing awesome-go project
> Although there is already awesome-go project (https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) exists with more than 90k stars. But it is daunting to find the right library which is production ready and properly benchmarked. Otherwise you could end up choosing some random user's untetsed code in your production system.

#### This project includes category wise Go libraries whic are:
- Production ready
- Large/Adequate active community
- Active Development and actively maintained
- Carefully choosen 1 or 2 libraries for each category.


#### What's your benefit ?
- Well, you don't have to browse and compare all 20 libraires for particular category.
- You can look stars, active dev and maintainance status in single go.
- Pick/decide required library in couple of seconds.
